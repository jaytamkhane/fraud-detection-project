ðŸ“Š Fraud Detection Data Analysis Project

This project is part of my internship with Accredian, where I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insights generation on a fraud detection dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

âœ… Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess the fraud detection dataset

Identify patterns and trends in fraudulent transactions

Perform feature-wise analysis to understand the behavior of fraud instances

Visualize key findings to support conclusions

âœ… Tools & Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

âœ… Project Structure

âœ… Key Highlights of the Project

Detailed data cleaning and preprocessing

In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Clear visualizations of patterns and relationships

Insights into features that indicate higher fraud probability

âœ… Insights and Results

Identification of transaction amounts, types, and patterns contributing to fraud

Detection of anomalies and outliers in data

Graphical representations for better decision-making

âœ… Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to work with real-world datasets, perform thorough analysis, and communicate insights effectively. It is part of my learning journey to becoming a skilled data analyst.
